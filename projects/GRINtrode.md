For my PhD thesis, I wanted to build a neural implant that could simultaneously perform 2-photon GCaMP imaging and electrophysiology in overlapping populations of neurons. 

The goal of this device was to record from the same neurons in the optical and electrical modalities. 

By fiber coupling the device to a coherent imaging fiber bundle, I was able to use the GRINtrode in freely moving animals.
