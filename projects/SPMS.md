When I was in middle school our science class got to use microscopes to look at samples we had collected. I had a blast looking 
at [rotifers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotifer) in pond water, and fell in love with microscopy. That passion has continued to
develop and I wanted to share it.

I found this [tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/id/10-Smartphone-to-digital-microscope-conversion/) from Kenji Yoshino on 
instructables and was able to gather supplies to build a dozen smartphone microscopes with the help of my department. Since then I've been
working with [CU Science Discovery](https://www.colorado.edu/sciencediscovery/) to share the fun of microscopy with local high school students
through the biomedical research bootcamp on the Anschutz campus.
